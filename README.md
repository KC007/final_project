 experimental board game
 
 

This is a board game similar to Go and it's mainly built in Javascript, CSS and Html using React Js. 
The idea is an educational customisable boardgame that can be used in the classroom. There are questions that are created to test the players' knowledge on 
topics. The player has to answer a question correctly to make a move on the board. They both start on the opposite sides of the board, whoever gets to 
the other end of the board is the winner.
